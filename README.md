Project Description: Exploratory Data Analysis of Heart Disease Dataset
Introduction:
In this project, we explore a dataset related to heart disease to gain insights into various factors contributing to heart health. The dataset contains information about patients' demographics, medical history, and clinical parameters. We aim to analyze this data to understand patterns, correlations, and trends that may help in understanding and predicting heart disease.

Dataset Overview:
The dataset consists of 302 entries with 14 columns:

age: Age of the patient
sex: Gender of the patient (0: Female, 1: Male)
cp: Chest pain type (0: Typical angina, 1: Atypical angina, 2: Non-anginal pain, 3: Asymptomatic)
trestbps: Resting blood pressure (mm Hg)
chol: Serum cholesterol (mg/dl)
fbs: Fasting blood sugar (> 120 mg/dl) (0: False, 1: True)
restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results (0: Normal, 1: Abnormality, 2: Probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy)
thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved
exang: Exercise-induced angina (0: No, 1: Yes)
oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
slope: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (0: Upsloping, 1: Flat, 2: Downsloping)
ca: Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (0-3)
thal: Thalassemia type (0: Normal, 1: Fixed defect, 2: Reversible defect)
target: Presence of heart disease (0: No, 1: Yes)
Project Steps:
Data Loading and Inspection:
Load the dataset and inspect its structure.
Check for missing values and duplicates.
Data Cleaning:
Drop duplicate entries.
Handle any missing values if present.
Descriptive Statistics:
Explore the summary statistics of numerical variables.
Data Visualization:
Analyze the distribution of age in the dataset.
Investigate the distribution of chest pain types and their relationship with heart disease.
Visualize the distribution of fasting blood sugar and its association with heart disease.
Explore the distribution of resting blood pressure and serum cholesterol.
Compare resting blood pressure between genders.
Exploratory Analysis:
Investigate the relationship between various categorical and numerical features with the target variable (presence of heart disease).
Conclusion:
Summarize key findings and insights obtained from the analysis.
Discuss potential implications and further steps.
Conclusion:
This project aims to provide a comprehensive exploration of the heart disease dataset, highlighting important factors that may influence heart health. By leveraging descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques, we can gain valuable insights into the relationships between different variables and the presence of heart disease. These insights can potentially aid healthcare professionals in better understanding and managing cardiovascular health.
