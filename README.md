Project Title: Heart Health Exploration
Overview:
This project analyzes a dataset of 302 individuals, examining factors related to heart health. Key features include demographics, physiological measures, and indicators of cardiac risk. Through visualization and statistical analysis, the study aims to uncover patterns and associations with heart disease prevalence.
Findings:
The dataset shows a slightly higher prevalence of heart disease (164 cases) compared to non-cases (138).
Most individuals experience typical angina, while asymptomatic chest pain is less common.
Distribution of fasting blood sugar levels and physiological measures like blood pressure and cholesterol exhibit typical patterns.
Understanding these relationships can inform risk assessment and interventions for cardiac health.
